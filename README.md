# flux-game-engine

A game engine made with C++ by a bunch or dum-dums

# How to setup this shit?

You have to get a version of the required dependencies e.g Glfw
and make a folder called extlibs at the project's root directory and after that put the name of the dependency e.g extlibs/GLFW

# dependencies

GLFW
Ninja
CMake
OpenGL 3.1 at least

# The command

if you're using any other thing than Visual Studio then just run:
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
else:
Visual Studio will deal with it
